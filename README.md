# Constructing a Stock Trading Game Environment and Implementing a Reinforcement Learning Agent to Maximize Returns - Under Build

**Note: (This repository is still under construction and the findings are by no means final)**

Welcome to Stock Street! An interactive gaming environment allowing the simulation of stock trading. The current simulation to show the current progress in environment building and mainly to show capabilities of the environment and hence should not be used for testing agents at this stage.

## Current Issues and Tasks to progress

1. Ability to trade two stocks only
2. Delayed runtime in multi stock setting
3. Insufficient trading signal information
4. Incomplete Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Agents
5. Improving environment rendering

## Project Content

1. Building a Stock Trading Game using Open AI's base gym Environment - In Progress but preview available
2. Simulation of Environment - In Progress but preview available
3. Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Agents: The agents of choice thus far are A2C (Advantageous Actor Critic), PPO (Proximal Policy Gradient), DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient) - In progress but preview available
4. Evluation of Agents in Single Stock Setting: Hyperparameter sweep of agents and to be compared to a Long Only position, a Clueless position on the basis of Cumulative Reward. Agent's actions and policy shall also be evaluated. - In Progress but preview available
5. Evaluation of Agents in a Multi-Stock Setting: Hyperparameter sweep of agents and to be compared to a Long Only position, a Clueless position on the basis of Cumulative Reward. Agent's actions and policy shall also be evaluated. - In Progress
6. Discussion and Results - In Progress
